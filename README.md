# Fire-Stations

For my lab, I chose to find different fire stations in my hometown area of Eastern Wake County, North Carolina. This map is very minimal with few stations and less population desnity than I was expecting. Eastern Wake County focuses on the fire stations of Knightdale, Wendell, and Zebulon, which I've grown up around as a child. This map doesn't include the new fourth station in Knightdale that is currently being built at the time of making this map. I felt it was best to only include the currently, established stations on this map. 

The main dataset was from the census data, to show the population density while the longitude and latitude of each fire station was hand made in a microsoft excel chart.
